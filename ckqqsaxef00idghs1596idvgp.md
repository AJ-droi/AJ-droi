It has been 2 weeks since the side hustle internship started and I want to share my experience so far.

I joined this internship to learn about front end web development, which requires a great knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The operation of this internship is remote and we learn via telegram voice chat and Google meet. 
(Let me quickly add this here "our mentors have been superb and accomodating").

Thus far we 've learnt how html, Git and CSS works with lots of audio,ebooks and video materials which has paid off in my growth as a front end web developer.

Our first task was to design a tribute page:

using HTML tags only.
It was a good start and it made me know a lot of html elements.
I also scored a good grade too.

Last week,we were given a challenge to create a responsive website using HTML and CSS.

Here's a link to the assignment below:

We are to host it using GitHub, vercel or netlify.

It was tasking and time consuming but at the end I was able to replicate it and i hosted it using GitHub.

Here are linkd to my github and the hosted website:

GitHub: https://github.com/AJ-droi/AJ-droi.github.io

Hosted Website: https://aj-droi.github.io

I honestly enjoyed this task alot, because it really made me understand what I was been thought during our live classes.
