We had just deployed the backend API server for a property management product built with **NestJS**, **JWT authentication**, and hosted on **DigitalOcean**.

Everything worked as expected.

Then a new developer joined the team. During our first technical session together, he reviewed the existing codebase — and started asking some thoughtful questions.

At first, I braced for criticism. But what came next was constructive, practical, and eye-opening.

### 🛠️ Here’s what he pointed out:

1. **Documentation with JSDoc over Decorators**
    
    > “Why not use JSDoc for Swagger? It’s cleaner and gives more flexibility.” I had been using NestJS decorators for Swagger, but his suggestion helped us future-proof the docs and simplify maintenance.
    
2. **Implementing Refresh Tokens**
    
    > “If you want users to stay logged in longer, consider a refresh token strategy.” We were only using short-lived access tokens. His point made sense — user experience matters too.
    
3. **Switching to dotenv-flow**
    
    > “Managing multiple `.env` files with dotenv-flow can make switching between staging and production smoother.” A simple package, but it solved a very real problem.

### 😬 My Initial Reaction?

Honestly? Defensive.  
My code worked. I had reasons for the decisions I made. But instead of shutting down the discussion, I did something different this time:

I listened.

I asked more questions.

I explored his suggestions — and realized they weren’t just good ideas; they were better than what I had.

---

### 🚀 The Result?

We adopted `dotenv-flow`, implemented a secure refresh token flow, and improved our API documentation setup.  
We shipped faster, onboarded new devs more easily, and improved our app’s security posture.

All from one conversation.

### 💡 Takeaways for Developers:

* Working code is good, but **collaborative code is better**.
    
* Feedback isn’t a threat — it’s a gift.
    
* You can be experienced and still have blind spots.
    
* Ego kills innovation. Curiosity fuels growth.
